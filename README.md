# CM2030-Graphics-Programming-Snooker-Game

This project is a simulation of a snooker game developed using the p5.js and Matter.js libraries. The game replicates snooker table physics, allowing the player to interact with a cue ball and apply various forces to simulate a snooker shot. Players can switch between different game modes and manipulate elements on the table.

## Features
- Snooker Table Setup: Full-size snooker table dimensions and physics implemented according to official rules.

- Cue Ball Control: Control the cue ball's starting position using arrow keys or WASD.

- Mouse-based Force Application: Apply force to the cue ball by clicking and dragging with the mouse.

- Game Modes:
  - Reset Game (1): Resets the game state.
  - Randomize Red Balls (2): Randomly rearranges the red balls on the table.
  - Randomize All Balls (3): Rearranges all balls on the table.
  - Add Random Red Ball (4): Adds a random red ball to the table.
  - Hydra Mode (5): Adds special "hydra" purple balls that multiply when pocketed.

- Custom Force Input: Players can input a custom cue force using a text box to adjust the power of their shots

## Installation and Setup

Prerequisites:
- p5.js: Used for rendering graphics.

- Matter.js: Physics engine to handle collision detection and object behavior.

Download or clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/WZhengJie99/CM2030-Graphics-Programming-Facial-Detection.git
```

Running the Game:

- Open index.html in your browser to run the simulation.

- Use the buttons or key presses to switch between game modes and interact with the snooker table.
